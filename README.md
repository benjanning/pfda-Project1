# Project 1 for the Programming for Data Analysis Module

## Introduction:

In this project I will be exploring the effects of various external factors on a person's salary in Ireland, through methods of analysis covered in our course.  This will be done by finding statistics on the variables: Age, Gender, Level of Education and Ethnicity.  I will then synthesise data using Python's built in functions: Numpy, Seaborn, Matplotlib and Pandas.

## Running the Project:

Written in the programming language Python and presented in a Jupyter Notebook, this file can be viewed and edited on a local machine using a Python interpreter, such as VS Code.  Alternaitively it can be run with Jupyter Notebook.
